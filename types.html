                    <h4>WEAK ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE</h4>
                    <p>aka. Narrow AI</p>
                    <p>
                        Weak Artificial Intelligence is a type of artificial intelligence limited to a specific area or to 
                        handle a narrow task and mostly used to simulate human behaviour rather than thinking like strong AI (Investopedia 2018). 
                        Although weak AI can simulate human intelligence, it does not actually possess any, it instead possesses a specific 
                        intelligence as opposed to general intelligence. Think of it as AI that can tell you the best way to get from point A to 
                        point B (like a GPS) but it cannot learn the best way to challenge you in a game of chess.

                        How does weak AI benefit society? 
                        By automating time-consuming tasks and by analyzing data in ways that humans sometimes can’t. 
                        This is very useful because in this generation, computers must constantly deal with Big Data (since our population is ever-growing). 
                        Weak AI can help analyze big data and turn it into useful information through detecting certain patterns or making predictions for the future based on the data. 
                        Some examples of weak AI are the advertisements you see on web pages that are meant to be specific for each user, 
                        or suggested purchases on your google play store. They use algorithms to determine the most suitable choice and must take in data.

                    <h4>STRONG ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE</h4>
                    <p>Aka. True Intelligence or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</p>
                    <p>
                        Strong AI are designed to carry out tasks that are considered to be human-like and therefore requires machine 
                        intelligence equal to human intelligence. They are much more complicated than Weak AI as they are programmed 
                        to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene 
                        (ie. to input new data). Some common characteristics for strong AI is having the ability to: reason, solve 
                        puzzles, learn, and communicate. It also typically has some kind of “self-awareness” or “consciousness” like 
                        humans and is able to interact with the environment around it. This is believed to be one of the next steps to 
                        technology advancement. With good assistance from AI, it creates lots of room for comfort and entertainment purposes.
