                    <p>
                        Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on equipping machines and computer systems with human-like intelligence and performing tasks that require thinking.
                        <br>
                        As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that do calculations or do things like text recognition are no longer considered to have artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as simple function of your computer or phone. 
                        <br>
                        As such, Artificial Intelligence continues to evolve and provide benefits to companies and society.
