                    <h4>DEFINITION: </h4>
                    <p>
                        Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on equipping machines and computer systems with human-like intelligence and performing tasks that require thinking.
                        <br>
                        As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that do calculations or do things like text recognition are no longer considered to have artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as simple function of your computer or phone. 
                        <br>
                        As such, Artificial Intelligence continues to evolve and provide benefits to companies and society.

                <h4>A SMALL HISTORY:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>How did artificial intelligence come to be?</li> 
                    <li>In 1950, a mathematician named Alan Turning changed the world when he proposed the question: “Can machines think?”. He then proposed a testing method to determine whether or not a machine could possess actual intelligence.</li> 
                    <li>In 1952, a guy named Aurthur Samuel put this into reality when he developed a self-learning program to play checkers. </li>
                    <li>In 1956, The phrase artificial intelligence was proposed at the "Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence" by John McCarthy. He then led a conference which defined the scope and goals of AI, is widely considered to be the birth of artificial intelligence</li>
                    <li>In 1958 John McCarthy developed the AI programming language Lisp and published the paper "Programs with Common Sense." which proposed a probable functioning AI system that has the ability to learn like humans </li>
                    <li>In 1972, The logic programming language PROLOG was created.</li>
                    <li>From 1974-1980, there was a major drawback on the development of AI because of the frustration with the progress</li> 
                    <li>In 1982, Japan launched the ambitious Fifth Generation Computer Systems project with the goal of developing some platform for AI and making more superior computers. In response, the US also launched Strategic Computing Initiative for the same goal </li>
                    <li>By 1993, both Japan and the US cite failures for their launches.</li> 
                    <li>In 1997 IBM's machine beats world chess champion Gary Kasparov</li>
                    <li>In 2008, Google makes groundbreaking progress by introducing a speech recognition feature in its new phone </li>
                    <li>In 2014, Google made the first self-driving car to pass a state driving test. </li>
                </ul>
